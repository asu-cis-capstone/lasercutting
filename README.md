Pitch

San San has started a small custom laser cutting business where she can engrave products out of wood, acrylic, and glass. Examples of products are wooden keychains, engraved beer glasses, coasters, and engraved boards that can be framed. We are creating a professional website (mobile friendly too) and digital marketing campaign to help expand her business and help it grow. Our measurements will be based on user interaction with our social media platforms and new website.
